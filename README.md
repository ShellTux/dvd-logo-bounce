# DVD Logo Bounce written in Javascript

"DVD Logo Bounce" is a fun and simple animation that simulates the behavior of a
bouncing DVD logo on a screen.
It is a popular beginner's project in programming and has been recreated in many
different programming languages.
The animation typically involves a bouncing DVD logo that changes direction and
bounces off the edges of the screen,
accompanied by a satisfying "thunk" sound.
The project is often used as a way to practice basic programming concepts
such as loops, conditional statements,
and graphics rendering.
In this example, the project was written in native Javascript.

## Usage

The behaviour of the dvd logo is quite dynamic.
The user can input the `speed`
and the `size` of the dvd logo in pixels.

For example:

```url
https://shelltux.github.io/dvd-logo-bounce?speed=5&size=256
```

The `size` argument will only change the width of the image
to maintain the aspect ratio of the logo image.
