# DVD Logo Bounce written in Javascript

"DVD Logo Bounce" is a fun and simple animation that simulates the behavior of a
bouncing DVD logo on a screen.
It is a popular beginner's project in programming and has been recreated in many
different programming languages.
The animation typically involves a bouncing DVD logo that changes direction and
bounces off the edges of the screen,
accompanied by a satisfying "thunk" sound.
The project is often used as a way to practice basic programming concepts
such as loops, conditional statements,
and graphics rendering.
In this example, the project was written in native Javascript.

## Usage

You can change the speed by which the logo travels across

The argument is called `speed`

```
